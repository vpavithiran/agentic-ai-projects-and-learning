      "| Aspect | Details |\n",
      "|-------|--------|\n",
      "| **Motivation** | Prior sequence‑to‑sequence models relied on recurrent (RNN) or convolutional (CNN) networks, which required sequential processing and limited parallelism. |\n",
      "| **Architecture** | A **purely attention‑based** model consisting of an **encoder** and a **decoder**, each built from **stacked self‑attention** and **position‑wise feed‑forward** layers. No recurrence or convolution is used. |\n",
      "| **Self‑Attention** | Allows each token to attend to every other token in the same sequence, weighted by learned **attention scores** (scaled dot‑product). This yields a **global receptive field** in a single layer. |\n",
      "| **Multi‑Head Attention** | Multiple parallel attention heads capture different types of relationships simultaneously. |\n",
      "| **Positional Encoding** | Since the model lacks recurrence, fixed sinusoidal (or learned) positional encodings are added to input embeddings to inject order information. |\n",
      "| **Training** | Uses **teacher‑forcing** for the decoder and **label‑smoothing** regularization. Optimized with the **Adam** optimizer and a custom learning‑rate schedule that increases then decays. |\n",
      "| **Performance** | On the WMT 2014 English‑German and English‑French translation benchmarks, the Transformer **outperformed** state‑of‑the‑art RNN/CNN models while being **significantly faster** (up to 10× speed‑up in training). |\n",
      "| **Impact** | The Transformer architecture has become the backbone of **BERT**, **GPT**, **T5**, **Vision Transformers**, and many other models. Its **attention‑only** design enabled massive scaling (e.g., GPT‑4, PaLM) and spurred research into efficient attention, sparse variants, and multimodal extensions. |\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Why it matters\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Parallelism**: By removing recurrent dependencies, training can be fully parallelized across sequence positions, dramatically reducing training time on GPUs/TPUs.\n",
      "- **Scalability**: The architecture scales well with data and compute, enabling the creation of very large language models.\n",
      "- **General‑purpose**: The same architecture is now used for text, speech, vision, and multimodal tasks, showing the universality of attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, **“Attention Is All You Need”** introduced a simple yet powerful architecture that replaced complex recurrence with a pure attention mechanism, setting the stage for the modern era of large, versatile AI models.\n"

      "**Short answer:** As of August 2025 the United States is imposing a **combined 50 % tariff on most Indian goods** – a 25 % “base” tariff plus an additional 25 % penalty (the latter was added because New Delhi continues to import Russian oil). The extra 25 % penalty became effective 21 days after the August 7 2025 announcement, so the total duty now reaches as high as 50 % for many Indian export categories (textiles, footwear, gems & jewelry, pharmaceuticals, electronics, etc.).  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why the tariff is 50 %  \n",
      "\n",
      "| Step | What happened | Effective date | Resulting rate |\n",
      "|------|---------------|---------------|--------------|\n",
      "| **Base tariff** | The United States announced a 25 % ad‑valorem tariff on all Indian imports (the “base” tariff). | 1 August 2025 (implementation) | **25 %** |\n",
      "| **Penalty tariff** | An extra 25 % ad‑valorem duty was added as a penalty for India’s continued purchases of Russian oil. | 21 days after 7 August 2025 (i.e., around 28 August 2025) | **+25 %** |\n",
      "| **Total** | **25 % + 25 % = 50 %** on many Indian exports (some items can be even higher if other anti‑dump or anti‑subsidy duties apply). | – | **≈ 50 %** |\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### What this means in practice  \n",
      "\n",
      "* **Most Indian exports** (textiles, footwear, gems & jewelry, pharmaceuticals, electronics, machinery, etc.) now face a **combined 50 % import duty** when entering the United States.  \n",
      "* The 50 % level is **the highest tariff the United States applies to any trading partner** in Asia.  \n",
      "* The tariff is **not a uniform “one‑size‑fits‑all” rate** – the United States still uses the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) to set product‑specific rates. The 50 % figure represents the **maximum** ad‑valorem duty that will be applied to most Indian goods unless other specific duties (anti‑dumping, countervailing, or anti‑subsidy measures) add further percentages.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Context & background  \n",
      "\n",
      "* **President Donald Trump** signed the executive order on **6 August 2025**, citing India’s continued purchase of Russian oil (which the United States views as financing Russia’s war in Ukraine).  \n",
      "* The **base 25 % tariff** had already been in place since early 2025 as part of broader trade‑policy pressure on India.  \n",
      "* The **additional 25 % penalty** was added as a “punishment” and to encourage India to curb its Russian‑oil imports.  \n",
      "* The move has **significantly strained U.S.–India relations**, with Indian officials calling the move “extremely unfortunate” and warning of possible disruptions to shipments worth **$87 billion** (U.S. imports from India in 2024).  \n",
      "* **Trade talks** between Washington and New Delhi are ongoing; any future trade agreement could potentially reduce or eliminate the extra 25 % penalty, but as of now the **combined 50 % tariff** remains in force.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Bottom line  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Current U.S. tariff on Indian goods** = **≈ 50 %** (25 % base + 25 % penalty).  \n",
      "- The rate applies broadly across most Indian export categories and will stay in place **unless** a new trade agreement or policy change modifies it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you need a **product‑specific rate** (e.g., for a particular HS‑code), let me know the commodity and I can look up the exact HTS‑based duty.\n"
